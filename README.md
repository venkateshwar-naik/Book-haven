# Book Bazaar

The Book Store App is a user-friendly application designed for store managers to efficiently manage records of all the books in their inventory. 
Upon entering these details, the app stores the book record, creating a well-organized inventory. The manager has the flexibility to:
Edit Book Details: The app allows the manager to update any of the three details for a book, providing flexibility for changes such as title revisions, author updates, or price adjustments.
Delete Book Record: If a book is no longer part of the inventory, the manager can easily delete its record from the app, maintaining an accurate and up-to-date catalog.
